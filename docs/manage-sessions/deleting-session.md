**TIP:** [Download a backup](../exporting-warc) of the session and/or the entire collection prior to deleting as a precaution.

1. Go to the collection’s [session management page](../session-manager).
2. Identify the session you want to delete based on the timestamp. If you need help tracing which session(s) to delete, try [inspecting the metadata of resources](../locating-session-id).
3. *Optional: Download a backup of the session.*
4. Click delete and confirm when prompted.
