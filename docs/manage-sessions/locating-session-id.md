# Locating the Session ID
{: .no_toc }

Each resource in a collection originates from a capture session.
The Session ID of the capture session from which a resource originates is shown in:
1. the Session ID column in resources view
2. the metadata inspector when a resource is selected

![Locating Session ID in Collection Manager](../../images/conifer-user-guide-016.jpeg)

Clicking on the resourceâ€™s Session ID will take you to the [Session Manager](../session-manager), where you may then [delete](../deleting-session) or [download](../exporting-warc) that specific session as a WARC.
