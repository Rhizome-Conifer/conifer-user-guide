# Patching a Capture
{: .no_toc }

Sometimes, a capture is missing important information or functionality. In this case, you can patch an existing capture. Patching allows additional content that was omitted on the original capture, such as missing images or pages, to be added to the collection.

After successful patching, the missing content should become available in the collection.

In the [session manager](../../manage-sessions/session-manager/), patch sessions are marked with a label and can be handled separately.
